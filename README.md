I learned how to create a Full Stack MERN Dall-E clone using Vite, MongooseJS, Express, React, NodeJS. 
Furthermore I used Cloudinary to upload and store images that is created with the OpenAI API. 
I also learned how to use different CSMs to host the application. For the backend I used Render and Vercel for the frontend.
In addition, learned how to secure the environment variables with dotenv.
